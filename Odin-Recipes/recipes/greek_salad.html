        <li>2 cups cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 red onion</li>
        <li>1/2 green bell pepper</li>

        <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 package feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Peel off a few strips of cucumber skin using a channel knife, creating a striped pattern. Cut cucumbers in half crosswise. Cut each half into quarters before cutting into 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices. Place into a colander; toss with some salt and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Meanwhile, cut cherry tomatoes in half. Rinse cucumbers; drain thoroughly for 10 to 15 minutes more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>While cucumbers are draining, slice onion thinly. Cut bell pepper into strips. Turn knife diagonally and cut strips into diamond-shaped pieces. Slice Kalamata and green olives.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Combine cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, olives, and 2 tablespoons oregano in a bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Sprinkle in vinegar and toss thoroughly. Drizzle in olive oil. Add about 2/3 of the feta cheese and toss again. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Give the salad another mix. Taste and season as desired. Scatter remaining feta cheese on top and garnish with remaining oregano.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
