    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggplants</li>
        <li>500g minced beef or lamb</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>400g canned tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Olive oil for frying</li>
        <li>For the béchamel sauce:</li>
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Slice the eggplants into 1/2-inch thick rounds. Sprinkle them with salt and let them sit for about 30 minutes to draw out excess moisture. Rinse and pat dry.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides. Remove and drain on paper towels.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In the same skillet, add a bit more olive oil if needed and sauté the chopped onion and garlic. Add the minced meat and cook until browned.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 20 minutes until the sauce thickens.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To make the béchamel sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for a minute or two. Gradually whisk in the milk, continuing to whisk until the sauce thickens. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In a baking dish, layer half of the fried eggplant slices, followed by the meat sauce, and then the remaining eggplant slices. Pour the béchamel sauce over the top layer. If using, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
